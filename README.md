# Decentralized Voting System

This project implements a decentralized voting system using blockchain technology. It leverages Solidity for smart contracts, Hardhat for development and testing, and React js for the frontend user interface.

 Technologies Used

* **Solidity:** For writing smart contracts that manage the voting logic.
* **Hardhat:** A development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity smart contracts.
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **Ethers.js:** A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Blockchain (Ethereum-compatible):** For secure and transparent voting.
